# The Intuitive Inference and Rule-based Reasoning in LLMs
Check the LLMs' capacity of Intuitive Inference and Rule-based Reasoning. Inspired by the distinct performances between answering '9.11 or/and 9.9, which is bigger?'  and 'which is bigger, 9.11 or/and 9.9?'.

## Introduction
As a reasonable answering style, LLMs usually state clearly the key answer, especially for a realative simple question. Such directly given answer of a question without a process of logic/rule-based reasoning is call **Intuitive Inference**. While the **Rule-based Reasoning** is like Chain of thought (CoT).




## Results
## The sequential order of 'rule' and 'numbers'
We considering two essentially indentical questions on number comparing, yet with different sequential order:
1. '9.11 or/and 9.9, which is bigger?'
2. 'which is bigger, 9.11 or/and 9.9?'

The performance difference.
